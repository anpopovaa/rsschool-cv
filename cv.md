## About Me:
My way in IT started as UX/UI designer. I had a lot of self-training and i chose trainee position at a Belarusian IT company and worked there for 6 months.
Now I'm interested in learning from the inside of the product, so i decided to study Front-end.

function countBits(num){
  if(num >= 0){
    let sum = 0;
